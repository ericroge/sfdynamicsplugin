# Contribute to the projet

We're actively looking for contributors.

For now, we (sfDynamics team) assume the task of maintaining and updating jQuery, jQuery ui and jQuery effects libraries,
along with some extra plugins we're either developping or using. But sfDynamics is not limited to thoose, and if you
want to take advantage of the plugin's features for your usual JS framework, you're welcome to become the referent contributor
for it.
