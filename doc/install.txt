# Install

To install the plugin, you have two major options.

## Use the latest release

The easiest way is to use the latest release available on {{{http://www.symfony-project.org/plugins/sfDynamicsPlugin|the symfony prject plugins page}}}.
Thoose releases are heavily tested, and you're assured not to get anything broken by any subsequent release. Just use the plugin:install task on
it and you'll be done:

[shell]
php symfony plugin:install sfDynamicsPlugin
[/shell]

### Use a git branch

You can also use directly a git branch, by cloning the repository. Depending on if you want to install it for contribution or use, you should use either
the `master` branch (which can be unstable) or the `stable` branch, which will always match the latest release.

[shell]
git clone XXX...XXX master
git clone XXX...XXX stable
[/shell]
