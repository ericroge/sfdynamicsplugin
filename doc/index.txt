## Configuration
# Javascript frameworks

We're actively looking for configuration writers maintainers for all the following javascript frameworks:

 * Prototype + scriptaculous
 * Yahoo UI
 * ExtJS
 * Mootools
 * Dojo

To know what configuration packages looks like, have a look at the {{{configuration|configuration reference}}}.

If you're interested in contributing to the plugin, have a look at the {{{contribute|contribute page}}}.

# History

This plugin is a result of much tries all refactored into one robust implementation of what we believe will be a real enterprise ready
alternative to the yet unreplaced old school symfony 1.0 javascript helpers.
