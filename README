sfDynamicsPlugin
================

Overview
--------
sfDynamicsPlugin is a symfony plugin aiming to manage client-side dynamics
behavior development within a symfony project.  It contains a
javascript/stylesheet package management system, with full dependency/conflict
support.

The plugin bundle the major javascript frameworks (jQuery, jQuery UI,
prototype, scriptaculous, extJS, and maybe more in the future) but does not
include anything in your site unless configured so.

We do not provide...
--------------------
The plugin does _not_ allow to switch transparently from a js framework to another transparently. It
does _not_ aim at abstracting javascript frameworks. Each has its pros and cons, and we don't want to
restrict each one's amazing features.

The plugin does _not_ provides helpers for common functions, like symfony 1.0 did. Javascript code is
written in javascript, so you don't have to learn a new PHP logic to write your scripts. It does not
simplify your life by allowing you to write JS without knowing anything of JS, but by doing so it
forces developpers to understand what their script do, and will save much time of debugging headaches.
